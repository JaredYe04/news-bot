  摘要（全文）：Rust has been named Stack Overflow's Most Loved (now called Most Admired) language every year since our 1.0 release in 2015. That means people who use Rust want to keep using Rust1--and not just for performance-heavy stuff or embedded development, but for shell scripts, web apps, and all kinds of things you wouldn't expect. One of our participants captured it well when they said, "At this point, I don't want to write code in any other language but Rust." When we sat down to crunch the vision doc...
